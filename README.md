## About ReadSocial

ReadSocial is an app that simplifies the coordination of book clubs. No more endless discussions and tedious research!
ReadSocial contains all the essential information about current reading recommendations clearly arranged in one place. Users can browse, favorite, organize and ultimately decide which titles they will nominate for the coming month. All book club members then vote on this so-called shortlist, so that in the end the book with the most votes is chosen as the next read.
