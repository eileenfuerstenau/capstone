# Capstone Project | ReadSocial | Eileen FÃ¼rstenau

## Capstone Project ?

The Web Development Bootcamp of the neue fische School and Pool for Digital Talent ends with the independent development of an own web app as a capstone project. From conception and design to every line of code, the entire app was worked on by myself. During the last four weeks of the 12-week bootcamp, I was thus able to repeat and deepen what I had previously learned.

## About ReadSocial

ReadSocial is an app that simplifies the coordination of book clubs. No more endless discussions and tedious research!
ReadSocial contains all the essential information about current reading recommendations clearly arranged in one place. Users can browse, favorite, organize and ultimately decide which titles they will nominate for the coming month. All book club members then vote on this so-called shortlist, so that in the end the book with the most votes is chosen as the next read.
